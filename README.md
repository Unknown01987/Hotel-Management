# Hotel Elite – Fully Integrated Hotel Management System

## Overview

Hotel Elite is a fully integrated hotel management system developed as part of the ITPM module. Implemented using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) alongside a RESTful API and various dependencies, the project aims to replace manual management processes with a fully automated online system, enhancing operational efficiency and guest experience.

This project was an exciting opportunity to leverage modern web technologies and develop a fully integrated solution to automate hotel operations, offering separate experiences for both admins and customers.
